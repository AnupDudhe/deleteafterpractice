what is infrastructure as a code ? IAAC 

You can create your infra in multiple ways ? 
using cloud gui
using cloud cli 
using sdk 
using IAAC tools

Various IAAC tools are

pulumi
terraform - Hashicorp 
For aws Cloudformation
for azure azure resource template
Biceps 

IAAC is called as infrastructure as a code 
your whole infrastructure of system engineering/cloud systems /network systems are captured in one script/code , and by running this
script you create a complete infrastructre from it.



various IAAC tools are 
terraform (is not restricted to particular cloud provider or restricted a cloud provider it has various reach upto all various cloud providers )
where as cloudformation (its restrited to only aws)
azure resource template is restricted to only azure 
pulumi and biceps(azure next answere to IAAC)


devops -
orchestration  - k8s 
containerization - docker
iaac - terraform , cloudformation , art 
configuration  - ansible , chef , puppet  
pipelines/deployment  - jenkins , azure devops  , github action , bamboo , gitlab cicd , argo cd 
bash script/python script /powershell script/ 




terraform - terraform script is written in .tf language.

its main blocks are  - 

provider 
resource 
variable
data
output
module
backend 



terraform lifecycles

terraform init - metadata is init and new changes are stored in this .tf / .terraform file 
terraform plan - its gives detailed blueprint or plausible output for the desired terraform file 
terraform apply  - creates or applies desired resource creation from reference of terraform file
terraform destroy - deletes/removes the created resource from the the terraform file 
terraform fmt  - gives proper syntax format to your terraform file














Provider block - gives terraform the information to create/ destory infra in a desired cloud that is mentioned in the provider block.

syntax 

blockname "cloudprovidername" {
   key: values
   
   
}


provider "aws" {
  region     = "us-west-2"
  access_key = "my-access-key"
  secret_key = "my-secret-key"
}

resource block - with the help of this resource you can create resource in a desired/particular cloud provider
syntax 


blockname "<provider>_<resource_type/type>" "name" {
     keys: values 
	 arguements
}
name = can be anything but must be unique and follow industry standards.


what is variable block ?
a variable block is variable passing block which is used to pass variables i.e attribute values to resource blocks 
just to avoid any human errors that might occur during modifying / changing any attribute value directly from resource block.
variable block supports following datatypes 
string (for string based argument values) , float (for float based arguement values) , boolean (for bool based arg values) , int (for number based arg values )
map (for key and value based arguements) , list (for list based arguements), any (you can pass all the above mentioned datatypes using any )

data types in terraform - 
tuples 
set *
list *
map  *
dictionaries 

float *
int  * 
string  * 
boolean  *

variable syntax 

variable "your_variableblockuniquename" {
  type        =  "mention here the data type" 3 = number , true = boolean , "t2.micro"  = string 
  description = "mention the value you want to pass" 3 , true , t2.micro 
}
 
instance_type = var.your_variableblockuniquename 
"var" is default syntax for calling your varible block in your resource block's argument 

variable "image_id" {
  type        = string
  description = "The id of the machine image (AMI) to use for the server."
}

how to reference the data from variable block file to main.tf file 

syntax of map variable - 

variable "this_map" {
    type = map  
    default = {
     purposeec2 = "webserver"   
     termination = true 
     count = 1
    }     
}

how to call map variable ?
var.this_map.purposeec2
var.your_variableblockuniquename.map'skeyname

  
null -> its a data type but it means nothing or empty data 
what is tuple ?


.tfvar and auto.tfvar -> this extension files are very usefull in terraform since , theres no need to mention any data in variable block/variable file , instead you will data in .tfvar and auto.tfvars file , variable block will pick data from .tfvar extension files
and reference in resource block. (.tfvar extension file requires command to direct variable block so that it can pick data from variable block
where as auto.tfvar extension file doesnt require no such command) another advantage is using this files you create another layer of variable refrences so that , any human error will be reduced.

Output Block  ->
output block is used to extract the output data that is generated from the resource that is created on public cloud.

output "outblockuniquename"  {
    value = provider_resourcetype.uniquenameofresourceblock.attribute

}

 output "public_ip" {
     value =  aws_instance.this_aws_instance.public_ip 
} 
 output "instance_id" {
    value = 
  
}
